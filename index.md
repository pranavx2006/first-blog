## 🕰️ The Vacuum Tube Era

In the early 1900s, **vacuum tubes** were the backbone of electronic devices. Invented by **John Ambrose Fleming**, they allowed current flow and were vital in early radios, televisions, and the first computers like **ENIAC**.

> 💡 Fun Fact: ENIAC had over 18,000 vacuum tubes and consumed more power than a modern data center server rack!

## ⚙️ The Transistor Revolution

The invention of the **transistor** in 1947 at Bell Labs was a major breakthrough. Transistors were:
- Smaller
- More energy-efficient
- Far more reliable than vacuum tubes

This paved the way for **portable radios**, **space tech**, and **second-generation computers**.

## 🔬 Integrated Circuits and Miniaturization

By the 1960s, **Integrated Circuits (ICs)** allowed multiple components to be embedded in a single chip. This:
- Made computers more powerful and compact
- Gave rise to digital watches, calculators, and early gaming consoles
